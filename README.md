If you want to download the data and jupyter notebook to your computer and run it locally. You might encounter some bugs when importing the packages.

2. Reinstall the package in the terminal

This project is to analyze the diversity in the workplace by the following steps:
1. Identify each employee's corresponding level (there're 6 levels in total)
2. Calculate how many people each employee manages (output a table with employee ids with the number of people managed)
3. Build a machine-learning model to predict the salary of each employee
4. Describe the main factors impacting employee salaries
